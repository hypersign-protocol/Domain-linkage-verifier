# Domain-linkage-verifier

By leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), DLV establishes secure connections between domains and their corresponding DIDs, thwarting fraud and phishing attempts. DIDs' cryptographic verification ensures data integrity, while their immutability prevents identity spoofing. This system simplifies identity verification, fosters a reputation-based ecosystem, and respects user privacy through selective disclosure. Interoperability and decentralization eliminate single points of failure, making it a resilient and privacy-preserving approach for the digital world.
